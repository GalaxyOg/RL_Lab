# RL_Lab
# The project is a python project practice of the algorithm in the book Mathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning by teacher Shiyu Zhao. 
# Part of document maze_env_5_5.py and maze_env_2_2.py in the project is referenced from Mofan(mofanpy.com). 
# In view of my limited programming ability, there are still many errors and irregularities in the project. I'd appreciate it if you could point it out
